# Memory Management Unit (MMU) Simulator

## Project Overview
This project is an Operating System course project that simulates the basic working of a Memory Management Unit (MMU). 
It demonstrates how logical memory addresses are mapped to physical memory using page replacement techniques.

## Features
- Translation from logical address to physical address.
- Simulation of sequence of references using three page replacement algorithm (FIFO, LRU, Optimal).
- Calculate EMAT.
- Page fault and page hit detection.
- Frame table, TLB and pages visualization through console output.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C
- Development Environment: Code::Blocks
- Operating System: Windows

## How to Run the Program
1. Open the project using Code::Blocks.
2. Build and run the project.
3. Provide the required input when prompted.
4. Observe the page replacement behavior, page fault count and calculate EMAT to observe memory efficiency in the output.

## Learning Outcome
Through this project, I gained practical understanding of:
- Memory management concepts in Operating Systems
- Page replacement algorithms
- C programming and debugging
- Problem solving and logical thinking
